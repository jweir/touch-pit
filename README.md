Touch Pit
=========

Sketch of a script to capture and replay Touch events.

I've started designing for touch devices.
I want to write tests for touch based scripts.
But I don't have any touch data to use in those tests

Therefore I am creating this.  To track and store touch data.

It is not yet properly saving the touch events.

What it needs to do is save all the event data.
On replay, it will actually create new events with the prior properties.
